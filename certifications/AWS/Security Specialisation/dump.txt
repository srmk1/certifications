----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I passed with score of 925/1000.
My study path-
1)ACG course
2)LA course
3)Whitepapers
4)AWS documentation/blogs
5) ACG discussion forums
6) Reinvent videos
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I passed the AWS Security Specialty exam on Sunday with a score of 861/1000. Thanks to ACloduGuru course. The course here helped a lot and I had already completed the Linux Academy one which was helpful as well. In addition to the ACloudGuru Security Speciality course, I has also gone through the videos and quiz for the AWS Practical Event Driven Security on ACloudGuru for few of the AWS Services - CloudTrail, GuardDuty and AWS Config. The exam simulator helped me in gaining confidence before appearing for the actual exam. I attempted the simulator test exam 3 times with 72, 83 and 95% score , identifying the weak areas and focusing on the same.

In addition to this ACG and LA course, i went through the udemy course on AWS Security by Zeal Vora for few of the core security services, esp KMS. Know the limits for No. of rules for NACLs and SGs and no. of SGs associates with instance, as there were few questions asking to block traffic from thousands of suspicious IPs which cannot be done through SG or NACL as limit allows only 100 rules per NACL i guess, and 250 rules per instance (50 rules per SG and 5 SGs per instance limit)

The KMS Best practices whitepaper is a must, as it did cover 3 to 4 questions (e.g. use of encryption context in key-policy and sample CMK key-policy to delegate permissions to IAM for an account) . Also go through the DDOS Whitepaper

Know the IAM policies and conditions, as couple of questions on what does the IAM policy do.

In addition to questions from core services like KMS, SCP -Orgnizations, IAM, VPC, Config, GuardDuty, CloudTrail , there were few topics which i thought might help.
- **regarding use of virtual security appliance device along with SGs and NALCs ( promiscuous mode ,etc) **
- scenario involving application deployed on ECS running inside a docker container
- scenario asking to prevent users from connecting to the Ec2 instance metadata service endpoint
- IP packet inspection (using third-party or from AWS Marketplace)
- When re-importing key material for a deleted key material to an existing CMK, whether to use a new wrapping key and import token, or using existing or old one
- Scenario involving configuring AD authentication in cloud and how to prevent connection from Cloud to On-prem but allow AD services in on-prem to connect to cloud
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The path i took was as follows:

- ACG Security Specialty Course - Re-watched the Summaries multiple times
- I write notes on paper while watching the course ( call me old fashioned ), i just feel it sticks better in my head
- Did alot of tries on ACG Exam Simulator till i hit 90%+ , as many have mentioned in the course, the Exam Simulator is amazing as not only it shows the wrong answers it also explains everything & provides links for it
- I Did the Practice exam using the free voucher from my previous CAA exam and got 80%
- I've referred to a post by Faye for 3 Cert Quiz Exams & another 24 Question Quiz - link here
- Went through most of the white papers ( did not fully cover DDOS though, I will in the coming days )
- Re-read KMS multiple times, checked FAQ for KMS as well made sure to check examples mentioned there by AWS
- Read FAQs for AWS Config, ELBs, WAF, CloudWatch & CloudTrail

What was in the exam ?
- Lots of KMS, Key Rotation, SSM Parameter store access to EC2, IAM Policies, External access to S3 buckets, AWS Config, Lambda, CloudTrail & CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor & Inspector
- Make sure to understand those well as when to use what, sometimes two answers work but the choice is made from the question context .. i.e “easiest” way or with “Least management over-head”
- Make sure to read through ADFS Trust with AWS, understand it thoroughly, double check all scenarios from AWS Documentation and make sure to let them sink-in
- Scenarios of On-Premises data center connection to AWS with which best approach i.e “VPN with Direct Connect”, actually a recall a question that combined both AD Trust for Company users & a secure VPN tunnel
- Encryption questions like “the user got an error while trying to access those files which are encrypted using KMS on the S3 Bucket” the IAM policy is shown & you are asked to select what should be changed to fix the problem
- What to choose for DDOS mitigation ? Shield ? WAF ? Guard Duty ? , i vaguely recall it but a question or two on this came up
- Also a question came on CloudFront, Custom SSL Certs & OAI
- All in all it was a nice journey, I hope this would be helpful for others soon to take the exam

 i read & re-read KMS & AWS Security Best Practices, a little bit of reading in cryptography as well, as mentioned in the post i also covered FAQs for KMS KMS KMS, AWS Config, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Trusted Advisor & Inspector, i did not watch re-invent videos
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I normally like to take 4 to 6 months breaks between each certification to keep refreshing my knowledge on AWS. I completed all my Associates and Pro certifications in 2017 and targetting to complete Specialities certification one in every 6 months to keep myself up-to-date. In that series, I completed big data certification in Jun-2018 and now completed my AWS Certified Security Specialty exam in January-2019.

Here is my study plan for AWS Certified Security – Specialty exam:

This exam is easier than either of the Professional exams and harder than any of the associate exams. At high level, this exam have pretty much good complexity and include some new feature which you won't find any of the course covering.

I will give Kudos to Linux Academy course for covering the deep concept, which appeared in the exam but you must go through entire course twice and complete all labs to get success. However, some concept you need to focus more, which is not covered in course mainly:
 Query logging using Athena 
 Cloudtrail integration with Athena 
 Amazon Macie 
 Glacier Vault lock 
 Different e-mail protocols in secure port 
 Quicksight
There is strong focus on KMS , Mutli-account strategy using AWS Organization and many troubleshooting questions. See more details at the end of the blog.

To know more about certification, Visit AWS Security Specialty Certification webpage.
To start the First step

Video Course: Recommend must go through Cloud Guru Videos first and then Linux Academy.
ACloudGuru Security Specialty Course - aCloudGuru has prepared  detail course material but not very deep , however it is covering all security aspect like KMS, IAM, securing S3, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, multiple AWS account access, Config, VPC, security groups, NACLs, and WAF.
Linux Academy Security Specialty Course - This is very detailed , deep and well alinged with exam along with labs. A must go course material for exam. Specially love their security runbook.
Go through this YouTube playlist for AWS re-invent videos.

Exam Notes:
Read through linux academy security runbook. 
Read through all questions explanation in Whizlab .
Demo Test:  
Whizlab test helped a lot to prepare well on many topics. You can purchase test here with nominal price and 240 questions.

Lab: 
Labs are must pass this exam. Make sure to go through all Linux Academy labs and follow along labs for all acloud guru practical videos.
