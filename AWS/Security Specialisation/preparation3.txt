I normally like to take 4 to 6 months breaks between each certification to keep refreshing my knowledge on AWS. I completed all my Associates and Pro certifications in 2017 and targetting to complete Specialities certification one in every 6 months to keep myself up-to-date. In that series, I completed big data certification in Jun-2018 and now completed my AWS Certified Security Specialty exam in January-2019.

Here is my study plan for AWS Certified Security – Specialty exam:

This exam is easier than either of the Professional exams and harder than any of the associate exams. At high level, this exam have pretty much good complexity and include some new feature which you won't find any of the course covering.

I will give Kudos to Linux Academy course for covering the deep concept, which appeared in the exam but you must go through entire course twice and complete all labs to get success. However, some concept you need to focus more, which is not covered in course mainly:
 Query logging using Athena 
 Cloudtrail integration with Athena 
 Amazon Macie 
 Glacier Vault lock 
 Different e-mail protocols in secure port 
 Quicksight
There is strong focus on KMS , Mutli-account strategy using AWS Organization and many troubleshooting questions. See more details at the end of the blog.
